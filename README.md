# Hi 👋, I'm Jose Estrella  

## 🌟 About Me  

I'm a passionate backend developer from Mexico with a strong foundation in software development and a deep love for solving complex problems. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions.  

In addition to coding, I am also a mechatronics engineer, documentation writer, baker, and a proud father of Bella. When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen, playing video games, or enjoying time with my cat.
